              <b><i>Browsing through the seven main sections:</i></b>
              <ol type="text-justify">
                <li>When you click on any of the main sections, you will see a page with the
                  sub-sections for
                  that section. For example, if you want to see what is available under Nepali
                  children's
                  literature, first click on the “Sahiyta” section. In the page that shows up, you
                  will see a
                  number of subsections, one of which is “Nepali Baal Sahiya”. Now clicking on the
                  “Nepali Baal
                  Sahiya” link will display all the materials in that sub-section. The displayed list
                  will
                  include the title and author of each item in the collection. This list is analogous
                  to the
                  collections of books you see arranged in the book shelves of physical libraries.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>Now “pull out” the book you want to read by clicking on the book title. For example,
                  if
                  you want to look at the book “Ko Thulo” by Srijan Sharma, just click on the
                  displayed link to
                  this book. You will see a new page displaying details about the book—details you
                  would find in
                  the first couple of pages of a physical book (e.g., title, author(s), publication
                  date,
                  publisher etc.).
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>In order to actually open the book and read it, you will need to click on the link
                  to
                  the pdf file displayed under “ Click here to Read/Download”.

                  Depending on your browser configuration, the link will ask you to either
                  save/open the file
                  or automatically open the file in a new browser window.In case you choose to save
                  the file, then
                  you will have to go into the folder where you have saved it, and click on the file
                  within that
                  folder which will open the book with a PDF reading software (such as Adobe Reader
                  for PCs). In
                  case you choose to open the file directly, then you can save it onto your computer
                  after it has
                  been opened.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>At any point while the user is browsing through E-Pustakalaya, if she wants to go to
                  any of the seven main sections, she can do so directly by simply clicking on the
                  links for these
                  sections on the categories bar right above the content area.
              </li></ol>
              Note: You can also browse through the library collections in a similar manner by
              clicking on
              the links under “Read more” in the home page.
              <br><br>


              <b><i>Using the link feature:</i><br></b>
              <br>
              Once you have gotten to step a (ii) described above, and want to browse through all the
              books by Srijana Sharma just click on the “Srijana Sharma” displayed in the author field.
              This
              will take you to a new page with a list of books written, illustrated or edited by Srijana
              Sharma.

              <b><i>Using the search feature:</i><br></b>
              <br><br>

              If you want to look for a specific item rather than just browse through the library
              sections,.say you want to search for a book entitled “putaliko bihe”, enter the title of the
              book
              (or the partial title) in the rectangular search field on the left corner of the top most
              navigation bar. Then click on the “search” button. This will lead you to the search results
              page,
              which displays complete or partial results in a list with descending search relevance. In
              order
              to obtain detailed information about the book, you can click on your chosen book. Then you
              can
              proceed to open the book as explained in step a (iii).
              <i>Note: If you have more detailed information about the item and want to enter that
                information
                to make the search more targeted, you can click on the “Advanced Search” button next to
                the
                search field and proceed to fill the empty fields that show up. </i>

            Becoming a registered user will allow you to have your own My Pustakalaya page, which will contain books that you have selected. In addition to this, you will also be able to use the bookmarking facility. By doing so, you can “bookmark” any book you choose, include it in your page, and thus create a personalized library of your favourite books (upto 25). Additionally, being a registered user will eventually allow you to make submissions to the library.

      <h4>E-Pustakalaya Terms of Use, Privacy Policy, and Copyright Policy</h4>

      <h3>Terms of Use</h3>
      <div>

        <div>This terms of use agreement (the "Agreement") governs your use of the collection of books, audio books, documents and other digital content (the "Collections") available through the digital library (the "E-Pustakalaya"). When accessing an archived page, you will be presented with the terms of use agreement. If you do not agree to these terms, please do not use E-Pustakalaya’s Collections or its Web site (the "Site").
        </div>
        <br>

        <div>Access to E-Pustakalaya’s Collections is provided at no cost to you and is granted for scholarship and research purposes only. You acknowledge that you have read and understood E-Pustakalaya’s Privacy Policy and agree that E-Pustakalaya may collect, use, and distribute information pursuant to that policy. If you provide any content to E-Pustakalaya, you grant E-Pustakalaya a nonexclusive, royalty-free right to use that content.
        </div>
        <br>

        <div>Some of the content available through E-Pustakalaya may be governed by local, national, and/or international laws and regulations, and your use of such content is solely at your own risk. You agree to abide by all applicable laws and regulations, including intellectual property laws, in connection with your use of E-Pustakalaya. In particular, you certify that your use of any part of E-Pustakalaya's Collections will be limited to non infringing or fair use under copyright law. If a Creative Commons or other license has been declared for particular material on E-Pustakalaya, to the extent you trust the declaration and declarer, you may use the content according to the terms and conditions of the applicable license. In using E-Pustakalaya's site, Collections, and/or services, you further agree (a) not to violate anyone's rights of privacy, (b) not to act in any way that might give rise to civil or criminal liability, (c) not to use or attempt to use another person's password, (d) not to collect or store personal data about anyone, (e) not to infringe any copyright, trademark, patent, or other proprietary rights of any person, (f) not to transmit or facilitate the transmission of unsolicited email ("spam"), (g) not to harass, threaten, or otherwise annoy anyone, and (h) not to act in any way that might be harmful to minors, which is prohibited by law and may be reported to the authorities should it be discovered by E-Pustakalaya.
        </div>
        <br>


        <div>You agree that we may contact you from time to time with surveys or other questions regarding your opinions about and uses of E-Pustakalaya, as well as with information we believe may be of interest to you. We encourage you to respond to these surveys because we value your input, which will assist us in improving E-Pustakalaya. In addition, we request that, according to standard academic practice, if you use E-Pustakalaya's Collections for any research that results in an article, a book, or other publication, you list E-Pustakalaya as a resource in your bibliography.</div>
        <br>


        <div>While we collect publicly available documents, sometimes authors and publishers express a desire for their documents not to be included in the Collections (by tagging a file for robot exclusion or by contacting us or the original crawler group). If the author or publisher of some part of E-Pustakalaya does not want his or her work in our Collections, then we may remove that portion of the Collections without notice.
        </div>
        <br>

        <div>E-Pustakalaya may immediately terminate this Agreement at its sole discretion at any time upon written notice (including via email) to you. Upon termination, you agree that E-Pustakalaya may immediately deactivate any password it has issued to you and bar you from accessing the Collections or the Site.
        </div>
        <br>

        <div>E-Pustakalaya may modify this Agreement from time to time, and your continued use of the Collections and/or the Site constitutes your acceptance of any and all modifications. E-Pustakalaya will attempt to notify you of substantial modifications via the email address that you have registered with us, if any.
        </div>
        <br>

        <div style="background-color:#fad390">Because the content of the Collections comes from around the world and from many different sectors, the Collections may contain information that might be deemed offensive, disturbing, misleading, fraudulent, or otherwise objectionable. E-Pustakalaya does not endorse or sponsor any content in the Collections, nor does it guarantee or warrant that the content available in the Collections is accurate, complete, noninfringing, or legally accessible in your jurisdiction, and you agree that you are solely responsible for abiding by all laws and regulations that may be applicable to the viewing of the content. In addition, the Collections are provided to you on an as-is and as-available basis. You agree that your use of the Site and the Collections is at your sole risk. You understand and agree that E-Pustakalaya makes no warranty or representation regarding the accuracy, currency, completeness, reliability, or usefulness of the content in the Collections, that the Site or the Collections will meet your requirements, that access to the Collections will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error free, or that defects, if any, will be corrected. We make no warranty of any kind, either express or implied.
        </div>
        <br>

        <div>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless E-Pustakalaya and its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, officers, directors, and employees from and against any and all liability, loss, claims, damages, costs, and/or actions (including attorneys’ fees) arising from your use of E-Pustakalaya’s services, the site, or the Collections. You agree that this Agreement is governed by the law. In addition, you agree that should any provision in the Agreement be found invalid, unlawful, or unenforceable, that provision shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions.</div>
        <br>

        <div style="background-color:#fad390">Under no circumstances, including, without limitation, negligence, shall E-Pustakalaya or its parents, affiliates, officers, employees, or agents be responsible for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages arising from or in connection with the use of or the inability to use the Site or the Collections, or any content contained on the Site or in the Collections, or resulting from unauthorized access to the Collections or your transmissions of data, including, without limitation, damages for loss of profits, use, data, or other intangibles, even if E-Pustakalaya has been advised of the possibility of such damages. Some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages, so some of the above may not apply to you.</div>
        <br>

        <div>This Agreement, the Privacy Policy, and other policies posted on the Site constitute the full and complete agreement between you and E-Pustakalaya and are not intended to inure to third-party beneficiaries.</div>
        <br>

     <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
     <div>

        <div>Our digital library (the "E-Pustakalaya") is committed to making its constantly growing collection of books, audio books, documents and other digital content (the "Collections") freely available to students, teachers, researchers, historians, scholars, and others ("Users") for purposes of benefit to the public. E-Pustakalaya offers its Users free access to the Collections. This open approach is somewhat like the situation in a public library, where staff and patrons might see who else was in the library and a bit of what they were working on. While E-Pustakalaya endeavors to enforce its Terms of Use and maintain standard computer security, it is important for both those who visit the site ("Visitors") and Users (collectively, "Users") to be aware of the open nature of E-Pustakalaya.
        </div>
        <br>

       <div>E-Pustakalaya may make changes to this policy from time to time and will notify you of such changes by posting an updated date in the Terms, Privacy, and Copyright link at the bottom the home page of E-Pustakalaya's Web site (the "Site"). Your continued use of the Site and/or the Collections constitutes your acceptance of any changes to the Privacy Policy concerning, but not limited to, both previously and prospectively collected information.
        </div>
        <br>

       <div>What Personal Information May E-Pustakalaya Have on Its Computers and Systems?
       </div>
        <br>

       <div  style="background-color:#fad390">Because E-Pustakalaya uses standard Web logging in its Web servers, our Web server may automatically recognize the domain name of each Visitor, each Visitor’s IP address, what Web page the Visitor requests, and the time of the request, along with a variety of information supplied by the visitor’s browser. See www.apache.org for details about Web logs.
       </div>
        <br>

       <div>In addition, E-Pustakalaya may collect the email addresses and messages of those who communicate with it via email or who enter email addresses in forms.</div>
        <br>

       <div>E-Pustakalaya may collect personally identifying information when a User registers for access to the Collections, including the User’s name, address, telephone number, and email address, and the Researcher’s proposal for using the Collections.
       </div>
        <br>


       <div>E-Pustakalaya may use "cookies" to track Users' activities on the Site and in the Collections. Cookies are small files that a server transfers to the hard drive of someone who visits a site and that the server can access when the person returns to the site.
       </div>
        <br>


       <div>The primary sources of content for the Collections are publicly accessible Web pages that were collected and donated by third parties, but E-Pustakalaya will expand on such sources through its own collection activities. For instructions on removing a particular set of pages currently included in the Collections, please see our policies and procedures for page removal.
       </div>
        <br>


       <div>The communications between you and E-Pustakalaya may pass through many machines, operating systems, programs, browsers, Web servers, networks, routers, Ethernet switches, service providers, proxy servers, intranets, the public phone system, or other devices (collectively, "Devices") on your premises, at E-Pustakalaya, and in between. Some of these Devices create logs of activities that are recorded on computer systems.
       </div>
        <br>


       <div>What Might E-Pustakalaya Do With the Information on Its Computers?
        </div>
        <br>


       <div>E-Pustakalaya has no intention to charge for access to the Collections. E-Pustakalaya may transfer the information on its machines, including personally identifying information, into the Collections. The Collections are made available to users and may be made available on the Site, or provided to third parties, for any use, without limitation.
       </div>
        <br>


       <div>E-Pustakalaya will not share or disclose any information it collects from Users, and will always enforce its Terms of Use or other policies, to comply with the law, to comply with legal process, to operate its systems properly, or to protect the rights or property of itself, its Users, or others.
       </div>
        <br>


       <div>It is possible that the computers at E-Pustakalaya could become compromised by others and that the information on E-Pustakalaya’s computers could be collected and disseminated without the knowledge or consent of E-Pustakalaya. While E-Pustakalaya endeavors to block "crackers" from breaking into its machines, E-Pustakalaya is not responsible or liable for any such unauthorized uses of E-Pustakalaya or its data.
